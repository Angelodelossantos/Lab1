    <h1> The Best movies According to Angelo Delos Santos</h1>
    <h2> My Top 10 Favorite Movies of All Time</h2>
    <hr/>
    <h3>The Shawshank Redemption (1994) </h3>
    <p>Directed by Frank Darabont, this film is a profound story about hope, friendship, and redemption. Set in a prison, it follows Andy Dufresne, a man wrongfully convicted of murder, and his unlikely friendship with fellow inmate Red.
    <h3>The Godfather (1972)</h3>
    <p>Directed by Francis Ford Coppola, The Godfather is a cinematic masterpiece that follows the powerful Corleone family through a tale of crime, loyalty, and family. Al Pacino and Marlon Brando deliver iconic performances in this epic mob saga, which delves into the complex relationships between family and power. 
    <h3> H is for Hawk</h3>
    <p> In the wake of her father’s sudden death in 2007, the English academic Helen Macdonald turned to training a goshawk, attempting to stave off depression by subsuming her grief in a relationship with a bird of prey—not just any bird but one considered notoriously difficult to train, even for trained falconers. But the goshawk’s fierce, unpredictable nature spoke to something wild in Macdonald’s own temperament, to her impulsive and perhaps self-destructive desire to withdraw from civilization, taking solace in the natural world and its primordial ways.
    <h3>Mel Brooks: The 99 Year Old Man!</h3>
    <p> My few but uproarious interviews with Mel Brooks disproved the adage about never meeting your heroes. He was the Mel a fan would want him to be—always “on,” eager to please and promote (and that’s only the p’s), and a fount of great show-business stories.  </p>
    <h3>Kidnapped: Elizabeth Smart</h3>
    <p>In the 1990s and 2000s, we had a series of high-profile child-abduction and child-murder cases, from Jaycee Dugard to JonBen&#233;t Ramsey, from Polly Klaas to Caylee Anthony to the Cleveland captives Michelle Knight, Amanda Berry, and Gina DeJesus. Each of these stories received breathless, national coverage, fueled by the emerging dominance of tabloid TV and the 24-hour cable cycle. (Cases involving missing or murdered minority children—and teens and young adults—were largely ignored, leading the late great journalist Gwen Ifill to coin the term “Missing White Women Syndrome.”)
    <h3>Mercy</h3>
    <p>The “screenlife” technique of telling a story entirely or primarily through desktop and laptop visuals has been put to effective use in films such as “Unfriended” (2014), “Host” (2020) and “Missing” (2023), as well as in a batch of TV series, e.g., the clever and innovative “Connection Lost” episode of “Modern Family” in 2015. (We also got a spate of mostly forgettable screenlife films and streaming series during the pandemic.)
    <h3>The Moment</h3>
    <p>In the summer of 2024, it seemed impossible to escape the neon slime color and lowercase text of Charli xcx’s sixth studio album, Brat. For a movie about the feel-good party season that never seemed to end, Charli and director Aidan Zamiri have taken a rather different approach than the traditional concert film featuring behind-the-scenes snippets of tour life and rehearsals leading up to a big show in front of waves of screaming fans. “The Moment” is something different, a big swing into the mockumentary genre satirizing the pressures of pop stardom and the strug
    <h3>Clika</h3>
    <p>Many musical biopics are essentially rags-to-riches stories, a parable about how hard work and talent with the right lucky break can make the big time. Michael Greene’s “Clika” follows in the tried and true footsteps of this still-growing genre but falls far short of becoming a headliner. The movie is a fictitious tale of an artist named Chito (JayDee, the frontman of Herencia de Patrones) who carries around a notebook of song ideas that he adds to in between picking peaches in his hometown of Yuba City, California, and making music with friends. When his family’s home is foreclosed on by the bank, Chito steps up his efforts to make it in the music business and branches out to work with his uncle, trafficking drugs, making the kind of money he never knew possible.
    <h3>The Big Fake</h3>
    <p>Have you ever been in a bind where you needed two signatures on a document to get by, and you were the only person in the room? If so, then you may have firsthand experience that forgery, or attempted forgery, can be something of a lark, something of a game.
    <h3>In Cold Light</h3> 
    <p>You don’t expect melancholy blue-mood ambiance in a fast-paced thriller, and this gives “In Cold Light” an emotional foundation it might not otherwise have. The film starts with a woman being chased by the cops; she barely stops running for the entire film, yet there’s this deep, quiet intensity underneath it all. Directed by Maxime Giroux, the film rarely lets up, but it is interested in character and environment, in mood and emotion, not just plot.
